# Top Trumps - Greek Mythology

This is a web-based version of the card game classic that is: Top Trumps.

## Customer Goals

* Easy to understand
* Attractive design
* Interactive with visible prompts such as visible scoreing/ rounds

# UX

## Scope

To achieve the goals I set out for this game, I included the following features:

* An easy to use webpage with buttons that are colour coded so they can be distinguished from each other.
* Simple card structure with a user friendly font that the user will easily be able to read.
* A contrasting colour scheme to make the page more accessible for users

## Structure

For this web-based game, I wanted something that was eye catching and would be easily accessible for everyone. The way i structured it was a bold title which instantly tells you what the page is about and contains, a few buttons which are required to begin the game/ compare your cards with the computer/ end the game/ go to the next round and a how-to-play button which will bring up a pop-up containing the instructions which reduces the need for scrolling when on a larger screen. Below this is the game are where the players and computers cards are shown (the computers cards remain hidden until the user has picked their attribute and clicked compare). 

## Skeleton

I created quick sketches of what I wanted the game to look like in Excel as it was easy to define the space and the frame of the site in its basic form.

## Surface

The colour scheme of the website was chosen to provide simplicity and to match colours used in artwork that depict the Greek Gods. The logo colour was chosen as it stood out on the sandy coloured background. The sandy background was chosen as it is a solid basic colour that made the blue colour stand out.

I chose the font 'GFS Neohellenic' throughout as it looks appealing for the Game and the theme I was going for. This font looks very similar to fonts used for other sites/ games that revolve around Greece and it's mythology. Furthermore, 'Sans-serif' was used as the default go to in case my chosen font couldn't be loaded. I used a hover effect on the navigation bar to attract attention and demonstrate the ease of navigation across all pages.

# Features


## Game Buttons

ADD HOW-TO-PLAY BUTTON AND GET SCREENSHOT

## Game Area

The game area is simply laid out with 2 boxes which I have coloured blue to distinguish them from the background. In the boxes to begin with there are just ??? until new game is clicked then the Players card will change to show a god/ creature card and attributes will be displayed next to the corresponding feature. There are also radio buttons for the user to click on, once one is selected that is the attribute that will be compared when the user clicks the compare button.

# Testing

## User Stories

1. As a first time user I want to be able to learn the game in a way that is simple and clear.
* There is How-to-Play button which opens a pop-up window whch details a simple guide in how to play the game.

2. As a user I want a simple game design which has obvious features where I can see my score and know which round I am on.
* Above the game cards there is a section dedicated to the score and the round counters.

## Testing

I tested my game on a few platforms including Microsoft Edge, Chrome and Android web browsers. I confirmed my project is responsive by using the dev tools on the web browsers and changing the sizes of the screen. I have tested the buttons and other features to check that they all work as they should. When troubleshooting the game I used console.log("") to locate any errors or to see whether a function was working or if it was doing something different to what i wanted it to do.

## Validator Testing

* All five of my web pages were tested using the official W3C Validator and they passed without error.
